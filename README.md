# Uintah Storytelling Festival

[My Notes](notes.md)

The Uintah Storytelling Festival doesn't have a webpage and I'm going to make it for them! It is going to be dynamic, engaging, and informative!

## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

The Uintah Storytelling festival just broke off from the Uintah School District after having a breakout first year of participation. They need somewhere to gather intrest and participation for upcoming years. What better way to do that than a dedicated website with recordings of previous years and a way to sign up?

### Design
